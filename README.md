robotframework-imaging
======================

Compare two images, asserting through a threshold value.

This library is designed to make comparison using the following engines:

1. PIL Engine
2. RMS (Root-Mean Square) Engine
3. PerceptualDiff Engine (add the PerceptualDiff binary in your $PATH first)

Most of this work is based on the great needle (https://github.com/bfirsh/needle) library with some 
improvement.
