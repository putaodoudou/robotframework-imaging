robotframework-imaging
======================

Compare two images using the root mean squared analysis.

This library is designed to make comparison using:

1. PIL Engine
2. RMS (Root-Mean Square Engine)
3. PerceptualDiff Engine

Most of this work is based on the great needle (https://github.com/bfirsh/needle) library with some 
improvement.
